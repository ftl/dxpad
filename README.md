# DXPad
This is a collection of tools I use to do HF QSOs as DL3NEY:

* Provide a simple text pad to take notes during a QSO.
* Gather information about a ham radio call from the online databases [QRZ.com](https://qrz.com) and [HamQTH](https://hamqth.com).
* Show spots from a DX cluster and [PSK Reporter](https://pskreporter.info) in a band map and a real world map.
* Integrate with WSJT-X to show information about the currently worked ham radio station.
* tbc.

## Disclaimer
I develop this tool for myself and just for fun in my free time. If you find it useful, I'm happy to hear about that. If you have trouble using it, you have all the source code to fix the problem yourself (although pull requests are welcome).
